## Description
This application is a working back end server that can host an ecommerce website and the different requests that the owners and users would need to make from the server. It has routes for [CREATING, UPDATING, READING, DELETING]. There is no front end for the application built so the routes are going to be demonstrated in the walkthrough video. This project uses the following packages: 1.) dotenv: this package is used to store sensitive server information in a separate file that can be included in the .gitignore file when pushing the repo to Github. 2.)express.js: self explanitory. 3.) mysql2: is used for a part of this application as well, apparently.
